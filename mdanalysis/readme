The main scripts are deposit into gromacs_traj_analysis directory.

there are something different when trajectories were generated using different MD software.

In gromacs the input files are "step_input.gro" and "md_production.xtc"

But when using NAMD or CHARMM, they are ""step_input.pdb" and "md_production.dcd". Thus you need to change the scripts about input files items.
