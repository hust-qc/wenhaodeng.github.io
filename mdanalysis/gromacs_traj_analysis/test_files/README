After the production runs using GROMACS, you may have xtc file. 
And you also need a setup model, for example md_setup_input.gro, which usually is used in the beginning of MD simulations.

In my scripts, I used step3_input.gro, which is generated by CHARMM-GUI. The other file is "step7_npt_production.xtc", 100 ns production runs.
